        <h2>Community Service</h2>
        <p>
            Community service has always been a big part of my life. In whatever way I can I always strive to make make a difference, big or small, in my community. This has led me to be involved in multiple service clubs and be chosen for leadership positions in them. These activities have also built up my experience and helped me develop my skills professionally as I learn how to communicate and coordinate activities with great organizational skills.
