        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my school and community I constantly participate in CS and STEM related activities working to explore and promote the topics.

                <div>
                    I am currently the lead engineer for competitive VEX team 2772J. I lead the team through the design, implementation, and programming aspects of the robot. I have qualified twice to State and National Championships and have earned multiple tournament awards. This includes Excellence Award (2x) (highest award at a VEX tournament) and Judges award.
                    Through robotics I also work on an apprenticeship program to educate girls internationally in the field of robotics.

                <div>
                    I volunteered at the Girls Who Code Summit 2020 and continue to participate in other GWC activities. At the event, I mentored kids and assisted them with
                    android app development. We started out by teaching them the basics. Then we helped them design their own application, assisting with resolving any technical
                    issues and ideating.

                    I am a creative director for Reinvented Magazine, a nonprofit organization seeking to reinvent the perception of women in STEM. I serve on the board of directors as a part of the leadership team, contributing to executive organization decisions.

                    I am on the marketing team for DVHacks III. I work to promote the hackathon and channel my passion as I make this opportunity available to as many people as I
                    possibly can. In this role I also combine my creative skills as a graphic designer to persuade people to attend the hackathon.
