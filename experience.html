        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my school and community I constantly participate in CS and STEM related activities working to explore and promote the topics.

                <b>DVHS Competitive Robotics Team</b>

                <div>
                    I tested onto this team and as a part of the team have been designing, building, and documenting the robot. We compete in Vex Robotics and follow the
                    engineering process as we ideate. This year, 2020, our team qualified to State Championships, however, it was cancelled and the season was cut short
                    due to unprecedented reasons. We also host an annual robotics tournament and teach younger kids about robotics.

                <div>
                    I volunteered at the Girls Who Code Summit 2020 and continue to participate in other GWC activities. At the event, I mentored kids and assisted them with
                    android app development. We started out by teaching them the basics. Then we helped them design their own application, assisting with resolving any technical
                    issues and ideating.
